I was inspired by the organ transplants dataset in the data is plural google spreadsheet and thinking about the relation between numbers of organ donators and presumed consent
These are the datasets in that spreadsheet, however, this is all abou the U.S. and I would like to find the donator numbers across the world:

In the United States, this is governed by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. In New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, willingness to donate organs for transplant is also listed on driver's licenses. In Australia, the system of notating organ donation requests on licenses was replaced in July 2005 with a national registration system and the issue of special cards. In Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), code "115" is printed on the reverse of the license to indicate that details are on the National Health Service (NHS) Organ Donor Register.

Datasets I need:
(1) A list of countries that implementing presumed consent (and priority allocation) and when did they start to implement the policy
(2) The newly added donator numbers over years

After three hours of research, I found it really hard to find the registration number and I learned some countries, such as Germany, they don't really do a registration but printing a card and carrying it with you, which makes it not possible to record registered donators. 
I'm thinking:
(1) narrow down to u.s., cause they have good data of registration numbers and also different opt in and out policies in different states;
or (2) use global No. of Deceased Donors, as the presumed consent will only work when the donors passed away. (this is by default effect (psychology))

The availability of donation education vs. the registration rate
"In California, the state has implemented a policy through which adolescents learn about the organ donation process in high school so they are well-informed about their options before making a decision at the Department of Motor Vehicles."

## How does organ designation work in each state of the u.s.?
When a patient has died or is near death, the hospital contacts their local organ procurement organization (OPO) and confirms his potential to donate. If the patient is confirmed as a candidate for donation, someone from the OPO will visit the hospital. If the patient had not previously enrolled as an organ donor, the OPO representative will seek consent from the next of kin.

# Hi, I'm Chen Wang

I am currently a data journalism student at the [Lede Program](http://ledeprogram.com), Columbia Journalism School.
I am learning all kinds of computational skills needed to turn data into narratives.
Before that, I did my MBA at the University of Toronto.
From China to Canada to the United States, my ambition is to tell engaging, compelling and important stories, in a professional way. 
Find my resume [here].
